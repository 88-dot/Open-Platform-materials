   * 在取流限制到前6s会提示time out，要重新开启视频。
* How long it will record the video by every trigger?

   * 触发一次动检，一般是录像10\-15秒
* 直播回放没声音
1\) 设置中audio打开
2\) 直播下面的喇叭按钮要打开
3\) 手机音量调高
*  How to link EZVIZ camera to Echo Show/google home?
关闭睡眠模式和图片加密，把设备名称改一下。
* How to setup EZVIZ camera with IFTTT?

   * We support one trigger and three actions.
   

   1\) Trigger\- 有motion触发

   * 2\) Action\-睡眠模式开or关

   * 3\) Action\-隐私模式开or关

   * 4\) Action\-消息提供开or关
   

   目前只在北美地区有，墨西哥，美国，加拿大
## DB1
* Three Options in EZVIZ APP?
After adding EZVIZ doorbell into account, the app will give three options to click: 
@ 机械门铃：有人按铃，DB1会短路150ms。Mechanical Chime: when ring button of DB1 pressed, DB1 will short out itself for 150ms.
@ Electronic Chime: 电子门铃，app会有1\-10秒短路时间可选，要小心选择，可能会使门铃声音不完整。
@ 没有铃铛：按门铃，DB1不会短路。
* 安装的时候power kit是必须的嘛？
实际上，不是必须的，不同品牌的机械门铃有不同的电流电压标准，但是如果不适用power kit，电流会一直流通去机械门铃里，可能会有滋滋滋声。
* When there’s no chime installed but click “Mechanical Chime” or “Electronic Chime” in APP, why DB1 will burn down

   * When click “Mechanical Chime” or “Electronic Chime” in APP, DB1 will short out part of itself when ring button pressed. \(let’s say that there’re resistance A and B series connection in DB1, when ring button pressed, resistance B been shorted out\), because no chime installed, the current goes through DB1 exceed its limitation, resulting to DB1 burn down. That’s why we need a fuse installed at this scenario. Generally speaking, o**nly select “Electronic Chime” in this scenario could let DB1 burn down, coz the short out time period of “Mechanical Chime” is only 150ms.
   **
* After installing DB1, the mechanical chime doesn’t work when press ring button?

   * 查看下接线是否是正确的，power kit接了没有。

   * 把DB1卸了，连接机械铃铛是否能干工作。
• If yes, it’s a DB1 issue.
 From software side, R&D need to check device log to check If DB1 short out itself or not.
 From hardware side, need to send device back to R&D to check.
• If no, it’s not a DB1 issue.
电线老化，电压不够 Power transformer aging, the actual power supply capacity is insufficient.
 power kit 不适配这个机械门铃The resistance value of power kit is not suitable for this mechanical chime.
 The current threshold of power kit would be skewed, could not short out itself.
 The mechanical chime has individual differences, the resistance value is not fixed, even for the
same brand, same model.
## DP1
* How to activate the main screen of the DP1?
There was a doorbell ringing outside the door, and within 30 seconds someone
was passing by inside the door
Alarm or video is triggered outside the door 
Press the wake button inside the door
* DP1 won't connect to WIFI and don't support strong password
For connect to WIFI, please check the following things: 
Make sure your device is connected to the 2.4GHZ WIFI.
Reset the device and connect it again.
For password, please ensure your password format is correct, the password cannot contain the special characters.
* Can the batteries in the DP1 door viewer be changed?
Yes, it's the 4600mAh Rechargeable lithium Battery.
* How I can have my DP1 on record 24/7 rather than motion detection only?
Sorry, this device only supports motion detection recording and doesn't support record 24/7.
* How do I upgrade firmware of DP1 using SD card?
Please copy the latest firmware package to an empty SD card, change the file name to “digicap\_upgrade.dav”, power off the device, insert the SD card, power up device again, and then click on Firmware Info\-\>Local Upgrade. It says “New firmware is available, do you want to upgrade”, then click “OK” to upgrade the firmware.
## LC1/LC1C
* Can the lighting mode be automatically switched between day and night? Will the lamp light up when the camera or PIR be triggered during the day for LC1C? 

   * The camera judges if it's during the day or night. The PIR works all day but only during the night will be triggered. Therefore, only at night will the lamp be turned on by the motion detection & PIR detection linkage.
## LC1、LC1C的区别
## A1
* How long does the alarm sound last for A1?

   * When K2 is triggered, A1 will last for 1 min. 
   

   Other detectors are triggered, A1 will last for 2 mins. 
   

   When T9 detector is triggered, T9 alarm sound duration is the same as that of A1.
   
* How far is the transmission distance between detectors and A1?
Theoretically, the wireless signal transmission distance between detectors and A1 is 100 meters in the open air.
* How many detectors can A1 connect?
An A1 hub can support 32 detectors. A detector can support numerous A1 hubs.
